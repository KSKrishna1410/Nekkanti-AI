# Summary of Changes and Resolved Issues

This document summarizes the modifications made to the Nekkanti-AI OCR application to improve invoice data extraction, particularly concerning IGST and other related fields.

### Phase 1: Initial IGST Extraction Fix

The primary goal of this phase was to resolve the issue where IGST data was not being captured at all.

**Issues Addressed:**
- IGST Rate and IGST Amount were consistently missed during extraction.
- The AI model was prone to "hallucination" (inventing values) due to high temperature settings.

**Changes Implemented:**
1.  **AI Model Temperature Adjustment (`modules/utils/ai_provider.py`):**
    - The `temperature` parameter for the AI model was changed from `0.1` to `0` to make its output more deterministic and focused, reducing the likelihood of inventing data.

2.  **AI Prompt Enhancement (`modules/invoice/processor.py`):**

    - The `temperature` parameter for the AI model was changed from `0.1` to `0` to make its output more deterministic and focused, reducing the likelihood of inventing data.

2.  **AI Prompt Enhancement (`modules/invoice/processor.py`):**
    - The main prompt was updated with a **Primary Directive** instructing the AI to **never calculate values** and to only extract data explicitly present in the document.
    - A clear rule was added to handle the mutual exclusivity of IGST vs. CGST/SGST, telling the AI to nullify one if the other is present.

3.  **Keyword Cleanup (`data/master_csv/Invoice_allkeys.csv`):**
    - Removed ambiguous keywords that were previously mapped to `IGST Tax Amount` (e.g., `"12%"`, `Total Tax Amount`). This prevents the AI from incorrectly mapping generic tax values as IGST.

**Outcome:**
- These changes successfully enabled the consistent capture of IGST data from invoices.

### Phase 2: Extraction Accuracy Refinements

Following the initial fixes, this phase focused on resolving more subtle extraction errors reported from the "Info Edge" and "Meesho" invoices.

**Issues Addressed:**
1.  **Incorrect Tax Calculation (Meesho Invoice):** The AI was extracting an incorrect IGST amount for a line item (`0.05` instead of the correct `0.48`), likely due to miscalculation or misreading.
2.  **Incorrect Field Mapping (Info Edge Invoice):** The AI was incorrectly mapping the generic `GST Rate` (`18%`) to the `igst_rate` field. *Note: An attempt to fix this by enforcing literal mapping was reverted at user request.*

**Changes Implemented:**
1.  **Tax Verification Logic (`modules/invoice/processor.py`):**
    - Implemented a robust post-processing function (`_post_process_tax_data`).
    - This function now acts as a safety net. After the AI extracts the data, this code verifies the tax amounts. It calculates the expected tax (`taxable_value * tax_rate`) and if the AI's extracted amount is different, it is **overwritten with the correctly calculated value**.
    - This verification is applied to IGST, CGST, and SGST amounts for each line item.

2.  **Further Prompt Enhancements (`modules/invoice/processor.py`):**
    - Added a more specific **"Field Differentiation"** rule to the prompt, instructing the AI to look more carefully at labels to distinguish between "Supplier" and "Buyer" details.

**Outcome:**
- **SOLVED:** The incorrect tax calculation on the Meesho invoice was resolved. The new verification logic catches the AI's error and corrects the IGST amount to the accurate value.
- **PARTIALLY ADDRESSED:** The underlying issue of the AI confusing similar fields (like supplier vs. buyer GSTIN, or generic GST Rate vs. IGST Rate) was targeted with prompt enhancements. While some improvements were made, these issues may require further, more targeted refinements in future phases.

### Phase 3: Multi-Page Processing and Advanced Table Extraction

This phase addressed fundamental limitations in the system's ability to handle multi-page documents and complex table structures, which were identified while processing the "Sterling RISQ" invoice.

**Issues Addressed:**
1.  **Single-Page Processing Limitation:** The application was hardcoded to treat all documents as single-page, merging text from all pages and causing data from subsequent pages to be lost or mis-attributed.
2.  **Poor OCR on Rotated Pages:** Text from rotated pages (like the vertical table on page 2 of the Sterling invoice) was being extracted as unreadable "jibberish".
3.  **Complex Table Extraction Failure:** The AI was unable to parse the nested, unconventional table structure on the second page, merging its data into header fields instead of the line items table.
4.  **Token Usage Bug:** A bug was introduced during development that caused the application to crash when calculating token usage for multi-page documents.

**Changes Implemented:**
1.  **End-to-End Multi-Page Pipeline Refactoring:**
    -   **`nekkanti_ocr_font.py`:** A new `extract_text_per_page` method was added to the OCR engine to provide text for each page individually.
    -   **`modules/utils/document_processor.py`:** The document processor was updated to use the new per-page extraction, returning a list of page texts instead of a single block.
    -   **`modules/invoice/processor.py`:** The invoice processor was rewritten to loop through each page's text, make a separate AI call for each, and then intelligently consolidate the results.
    -   **`main_modular.py`:** The main API endpoint was updated to dynamically handle the multi-page data, setting the correct page count and building the `pageWiseData` JSON array correctly.

2.  **Automatic Orientation Correction:**
    -   **`nekkanti_ocr_font.py`:** Enabled the `use_doc_orientation_classify=True` setting in the PaddleOCR engine. This allows the system to automatically detect the orientation of each page and rotate it to be upright before performing OCR.

3.  **Advanced Table Extraction via Prompt Engineering:**
    -   **`templates/prompts/invoice_extraction.jinja`:** After an initial failed attempt was reverted, the prompt was successfully enhanced by adding a specific, concrete example of a complex table with nested headers. This provided the AI with a clear template for how to flatten the headers and structure the JSON for the difficult table on the second page.

4.  **Bug Fixes:**
    -   **`modules/utils/ai_provider.py`:** An `accumulate` method was added to the `TokenUsage` class to fix the token calculation crash.
    -   **`streamlit_apps/bank_statement_app.py`:** A bug was fixed where the Bank Statement viewer was also hardcoded to only show the first page. It now correctly displays all pages.

**Outcome:**
- The system can now accurately process multi-page documents, correctly identifying page counts and separating data on a per-page basis.
- OCR quality on rotated pages is significantly improved, eliminating the "jibberish" text issue.
- The system can now successfully extract data from the complex, nested table on the second page of the Sterling invoice.
- The application is more robust and capable of handling a wider variety of invoice layouts and formats.


### Current Status

The system is now significantly more accurate in capturing invoice data. Key issues related to IGST capture and calculation have been resolved. The primary remaining challenge is improving the AI's ability to consistently differentiate between similar-looking but distinct fields on complex invoices.
    - A clear rule was added to handle the mutual exclusivity of IGST vs. CGST/SGST, telling the AI to nullify one if the other is present.

3.  **Keyword Cleanup (`data/master_csv/Invoice_allkeys.csv`):**
    - Removed ambiguous keywords that were previously mapped to `IGST Tax Amount` (e.g., `"12%"`, `Total Tax Amount`). This prevents the AI from incorrectly mapping generic tax values as IGST.
