**SPECIFIC EXTRACTION RULES:**

**HSN/SAC CODE EXTRACTION:**
- Look for HSN/SAC codes in dedicated columns
- If HSN/SAC codes are embedded within item descriptions (e.g., "Widget ABC [HSN: 12345]"), extract the code to HSN field AND keep full description
- Common patterns: "HSN: 12345", "SAC: 67890", "[12345]", "(HSN-12345)"
- Copy HSN/SAC codes exactly including any formatting or prefixes

**DISCOUNT COLUMN EXTRACTION:**
- Always scan for discount columns: "Discount", "Disc", "Disc%", "Disc Amt", "Discount Amount", "Discount %"
- Extract discount values exactly as written (could be percentage like "10%" or amount like "100.00")
- Do NOT skip discount columns even if they appear empty - use null for empty cells
- Do NOT calculate discounts - only extract what is explicitly written

**TABLE COMPLETENESS RULES:**
- Extract ALL columns present in the table
- Do NOT skip any columns including: Description, HSN/SAC, Qty, Unit, Rate, Discount, Taxable Value, Tax Details, Amount
- Preserve original column structure and data

**MANDATORY EXTRACTION CHECKLIST:**
Before finalizing your response, verify:
✓ Processed ALL pages in the document
✓ Extracted ALL line items from ALL pages  
✓ Extracted ALL table columns (including discount columns)
✓ HSN/SAC codes extracted from descriptions if embedded
✓ No calculations or assumptions made
✓ All amounts copied exactly as written
✓ All text preserved character-for-character
✓ Sequential numbering maintained across pages
✓ No fields filled with guessed or inferred values
✓ Tax information only extracted if explicitly labeled

**STRICT OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Return ONLY valid JSON
- NO explanations, comments, or additional text
- NO markdown formatting or code blocks
- Ensure all JSON syntax is perfect
- Use null for any missing fields, never empty strings or placeholder text

**ZERO CREATIVITY ENFORCEMENT:**
If you find yourself about to:
- Calculate a missing total → STOP, use null instead
- Assume a missing field → STOP, use null instead  
- Infer information from context → STOP, use null instead
- Format or clean up text → STOP, copy exactly as written
- Estimate or round numbers → STOP, copy exactly as written

**EXTRACTION INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. Extract ALL line items from ALL pages - do not skip any
2. Copy serial numbers exactly as written (S.No, Sl.No, Item No, #, etc.)
3. Copy item descriptions completely without truncation
4. **HSN/SAC HANDLING:** If HSN/SAC codes are merged within item descriptions, extract them to separate HSN fields AND keep complete description intact
5. **DISCOUNT COLUMN:** Always look for and extract discount columns (Disc, Discount, Disc%, Disc Amt) - do NOT skip them
6. Copy all amounts exactly as written (preserve commas, decimals, currency symbols)
7. Extract tax information only if explicitly labeled as GST/CGST/SGST/IGST/VAT/Tax
8. If no serial numbers exist in document, do NOT generate them - use null
9. Maintain exact sequential order as items appear in the document
10. For multi-page items, continue extraction seamlessly across pages
11. **COLUMN DETECTION:** Look for ALL table columns including: Description, HSN/SAC, Qty, Rate, Discount, Taxable Amount, Tax rates, Tax amounts, Total

**INDIAN GST EXTRACTION RULES:**
- **IGST vs. CGST/SGST:**
  - If you see "IGST" mentioned, extract it. IGST is for inter-state sales.
  - If you see "CGST" and "SGST" mentioned, extract them. CGST and SGST are for intra-state sales.
  - **CRITICAL RULE:** An invoice will have EITHER IGST OR a combination of CGST and SGST. They are mutually exclusive. If you find any value for IGST, you MUST set CGST and SGST values to null. If you find values for CGST and SGST, you MUST set IGST to null. Prioritize extracting the tax type that has explicit non-zero amounts listed.
- **Generic Tax:** If you only see a generic "Tax" or "GST" field without specifying the type, try to infer it. If buyer and seller are in different states (if visible), it's likely IGST. If they are in the same state, it's CGST/SGST. If you cannot determine the type, extract the value into `gst_amount` and `gst_rate`.
- **Header vs. Line Items:** Extract taxes from both the header (e.g., "Total IGST") and from each line item in the table.
